# Enhanced Peak Event Detection - Summary of Improvements

## Overview
The Advanced Peak Event Detection section (Section 3) in the energy analysis application has been significantly enhanced with better statistics and summary metrics focused on Maximum Demand (MD) management.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. ✅ Removed "Total Energy Shave" Metric
- **Before**: Displayed total energy to shave across all events (not useful for MD management)
- **After**: Replaced with more practical MD-focused metrics

### 2. ✅ Fixed Total Cost Impact Calculation
- **Before**: Incorrectly summed MD costs from all peak events 
- **After**: Correctly calculates MD cost based on only the **highest single event** of the month
- **Why**: TNB charges MD based on the single highest 30-minute reading, not cumulative events

### 3. ✅ Added Range of kWh per Event to be Shaved Daily
- **New Feature**: Shows daily kWh range (min - max) that needs to be shaved
- **Benefit**: Helps understand daily variation in energy management requirements

### 4. ✅ Accounted for 30-Minute MD Recording Intervals
- **Enhancement**: Added insights about 30-minute interval considerations
- **Details**: 
  - Shows total peak intervals (30-min blocks)
  - Explains that MD is recorded every 30 minutes during peak periods
  - Clarifies that multiple events per day may result in same MD cost

### 5. ✅ Enhanced Daily Event Grouping Statistics
- **New Metrics**:
  - Days with Peak Events
  - Average Events per Day
  - Highest Single Excess (most critical for MD cost)
  - Proper Monthly MD Cost (highest event only)

### 6. ✅ Improved MD Management Insights
- **Expandable Section**: Detailed MD Management Insights with:
  - Peak Events Analysis (total events, days affected, highest excess)
  - MD Cost Strategy (explains MD charging methodology)
  - Efficiency metrics (cost per kWh shaved)
  - Strategic recommendations (focus on worst day)

### 7. ✅ Updated Threshold Sensitivity Analysis
- **Fixed**: MD cost calculation in threshold analysis table
- **Enhanced**: Chart now shows "Monthly MD Cost" instead of misleading "Energy to Shave"
- **Column Update**: "Total Cost Impact" → "Monthly MD Cost" for clarity

### 8. ✅ Added Educational Content
- **MD Calculation Methodology Box**: Explains the correct way MD charges work:
  - 30-minute recording intervals
  - Single highest reading charge methodology
  - Strategic focus recommendations

## Technical Changes

### New Enhanced Summary Metrics Display:
```
┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│ Days with Peak      │ Max MD Impact       │ Avg Events/Day      │ Daily kWh Range     │
│ Events              │ (Monthly)           │                     │                     │
├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│ 5                   │ RM 250.50           │ 2.3                 │ 15.2 - 45.8         │
└─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

### Improved Chart Visualization:
- X-axis: Target Threshold (% of Max Demand)
- Y-axis (Left): Number of Peak Events
- Y-axis (Right): **Monthly MD Cost (RM)** [Previously: Energy to Shave]

### Enhanced Data Processing:
- Events are now grouped by day for better analysis
- MD cost calculation follows TNB methodology (highest single event)
- 30-minute interval considerations are properly accounted for
- Daily kWh ranges provide actionable insights

## Benefits for Users

1. **Accurate Cost Projections**: MD costs now reflect actual TNB charging methodology
2. **Better Strategic Planning**: Focus on reducing the single worst event rather than total event count
3. **Daily Management Insights**: Understand daily variation in energy management requirements
4. **Improved ROI Calculations**: More accurate cost-benefit analysis for demand management investments
5. **Educational Value**: Users understand how MD charges actually work

## Color Scheme Improvements (Previously Completed)
- Enhanced compatibility with both day and night modes in Streamlit
- Updated chart colors for better accessibility
- Improved table styling with transparency

## Files Modified
- `/workspaces/energyanalaysis-2/streamlit_app.py` - Main application file with enhanced peak event detection

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
All requested enhancements have been successfully implemented and tested. The Advanced Peak Event Detection section now provides much more practical and accurate MD management statistics.
